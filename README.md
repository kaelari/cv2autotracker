# Kaelari's Automated item tracker for CV2

![](https://i.imgur.com/dqSsckJ.png)

Displays all items and lights up when you have a given item, unlights if you lose that item. This is primarily intended for streamers to be able to show what items they have at all times. You can also click on things to manually toggle them.

The automation will only work with FCEUX.

To switch to flat mode click the blank space in the bottom right. This should have an icon but nothing i tried looked right. the right most space in flat mode will switch back to square mode.

All constructive feedback is appreciated and welcomed.
